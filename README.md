# Network Traffic Capture and Analysis

## Objective
Capture live network packets using Wireshark, analyze them, and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

## Steps
- Installed Wireshark.
- Captured live traffic on active network interface.
- Generated traffic (ping + browsing).
- Filtered packets (HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP).
- Saved the capture as captured-packets.pcap.

## Protocols Observed
- DNS – domain resolution
- HTTP – web traffic
- TCP – reliable communication
- UDP – connectionless communication

## Deliverables
- captured-packets.pcap – exported capture file
- report.docx – short analysis report

---
This task gave hands-on experience with packet analysis and improved understanding of protocol behavior in real networks.
